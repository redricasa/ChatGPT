## Installation
- Be sure to update your machine with the latest version of python! You might need to uninstall the older versions
- use 'pip3 install [ module]' for:
  > os
  > python-dotenv
  > openai
- Setup your .env file with KEY="[your API key]":
  - Under your profile pic, click on 'View API Keys' and click on 'Create new secret key'
  - create a .gitignore file and type in '.env'
- The free trial will end after a dozen or two of requests. It's recommended to bill for a chat subscription!

## TODO
- Design and Build the frontend website for this app!
